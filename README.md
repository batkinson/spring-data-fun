# Spring Data Fun

An example servlet-based RESTful service using Spring, Spring MVC, Spring
Security, Spring Data, Spring Data Rest and Hibernate Search.

## Why?

I wrote this because I wanted to get acquainted with the accompanying
technologies. I wanted a working example so I could see how the pieces fit
together, evaluate the tradeoffs involved and to distill the concepts down to
their basic parts. The application itself provides no meaningful value as a
standalone product. However, it is a good example demonstrating how to hook up
the various tools to work together in concert.

## Requirements

To build and run the project, you need:

  * A working [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) installation

## Running

To run the project, you simply need to execute the following:

```
# Build and run the project
mvn jetty:run
```

This will start the application using the Jetty servlet container on
http://localhost:8080/.
